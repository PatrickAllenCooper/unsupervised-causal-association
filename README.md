# unsupervised-causal-association
Can unsupervised networks capture causal associations?

Unsupervised networks have demonstrated stellar capabilities when it comes to capturing spatial or temporal data in visual scenes.

There remains the question which I believe has yet to be solved as to whether they can be said to generally express counterfacutal awareness.

Further, we should seek to pose the question as to what expression causal belief will take when we traverse latent space representation.

# Methodology

We must allow the model to cognize 2 eventual states which are contingent on a singular choice which must be embedded within time. To ensure this happens I propse using a variational autoencoder and based on the beta-VAE architecture, we will then use this arhitecture to devise a novel way to embedd this into the state representation using mutual information as a comparison metric. Solving this will take extensive experimentation.
